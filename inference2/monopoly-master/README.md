monopoly
========
I am trying to build a [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)) simulator in Python. By creating a (very) simple model of how human intelligence operates in the highly-structured environment of a board game, I hope to collect some data about how risk preferences influence game outcomes in a multi-player situation.

A secondary goal of this project is to see how far I can take this program idea as a coder without any formal background in software engineering or artificial intelligence. You can follow the progress of this project on its blog, [Python Monopoly](https://pythonmonopoly.wordpress.com/).
